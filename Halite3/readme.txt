TODO
- DONE: Get rid of CostCell
- DONE: Get rid of Map.this[Position] and use [x, y] instead
- DONE: CostField factories
- DONE: go home should use an inverted curve, ie steep sides. So that bot follows ravines home.
- DONE: Pass in peaks/walls as a list
- DONE: More than 1 ship picked the same target

- overlay multi-flows so that all rich means are peaks
- merge cost and wave
- for wave, ship should be goal, and everything flows out from that
- Check if IsWorthMining is correct - it might be ok to mine to 0
- Anti-squat still not working
- For path finding, mark all target positions as walls
